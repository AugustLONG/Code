Problem Statement

Gandalf is travelling from Rohan to Rivendell to meet Frodo but there is no direct route from Rohan (T1) to Rivendell (Tn).

But there are towns T2,T3,T4...Tn-1 such that there are N1 routes from Town T1 to T2, and in general, Ni routes from Ti
to Ti+1 for i=1 to n-1 and 0 routes for any other Ti to Tj for j â‰  i+1

Find the total number of routes Gandalf can take to reach Rivendell from Rohan.
