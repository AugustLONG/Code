Problem Statement

Sherlock is given 2 square tiles, initially both of whose sides have length L placed in an xâˆ’y plane; so that the left
bottom of each square coincides with the the origin and their sides are parallel to the axes.

At t=0, both squares start moving along line y=x (along the positive x and y) with velocities S1 and S2.

For each query of form qi, Sherlock has to report the time at which the overlapping area of tiles is equal to qi.
