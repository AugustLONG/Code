"""
We have the following method used in a chess game: boolean canMoveTo(int x, int y) x and y are the coordinates of the chess board and it returns whether or not the piece can move to that position.
Explain how you would test this method.

Analyze:
* input negative integer of x, y
* input larger value of x, y, which bigger than bound value
* input bound value of x, y, such as 0 or/and max value
* known value, some value which will produce know result
* some random valid value, just check if it will crash
