\section{Shuffle}
Equal probability shuffle algorithm.

\subsection{Incorrect naive solution}
Swap current card $A_i$ with a random card from the deck. 
\begin{java}
for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
   int j = (int) Math.random()*N;
   swap(a[i], a[j]);
}
\end{java}
The easiest proof that this algorithm does not produce a uniformly random permutation is that it generates 27 possible outcomes, but there are only 3! = 6 permutations. Since $27\%3 \neq 0$, there must be some permutation is that is picked too much, and some that is picked to little.
\subsection{Knuth Shuffle}
Knuth (aka Fisher-Yates) shuffling algorithm guarantees to rearrange the elements in uniformly random order. 
\\
Core clues:
\begin{enumerate}
\item choose index uniformly $\in [i, N)$
\end{enumerate}
\begin{java}
public void shuffle(Object[] a) {
    int N = a.length;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        // choose index uniformly in [i, N)
        int j = i + (int) (Math.random() * (N - i));
        swap(a[i], a[j]);
    }
}
\end{java}
